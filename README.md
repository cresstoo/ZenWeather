ZenWeather
============
ZenWeather is a simple weather app developed in Swift language. 

I spent about 3 hours in Jakelin's [Swift Weather App](http://www.imooc.com/learn/149) course and finally made this app without any programming knowledge.

## What I learned

- How to setup an iOS Dev environment
- Xcode Basic Usage
- CocoaPods Installation
- Prototyping with Interface Builder & Storyboard
